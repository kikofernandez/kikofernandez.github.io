Community Service
====================

* I have been the vice-chair of the ACM-W student chapter at Uppsala University
  for the last 3 years, promoting gender equality. As part of this activity, we
  successfully got a 6000 $ grant from Microsoft, to continue promoting gender
  equality at Uppsala University. This led to the organisation of the Ada
  Lovelace celebration in 2017, where we brought international speakers and
  researchers to promote gender equality (http://uu.acm.org).

* I have been elected as publicity chair for the group of conferences DisCoTec 2019, 2020,
  and Student Volunteer co-chair of SPLASH'19.

* I am part of a student chapter that promotes privacy and security
  technologies, ranging from topics such as email encryption to how to surf the
  web safely

* I promote open source technology, writing articles at opensource.com
  (https://opensource.com/users/kikofernandez). These articles are always posted
  also in different student channels to promote open source technology among
  students at Uppsala University.

* As part of promoting the open source technologies, I was accepted to
  an industry conference, PartialConf'18, where I explained how we have built
  the open source compiler for the language Encore, developed at Uppsala
  University (Partial'18 in Sofia, http://partialconf.com/lineup\#kiko-fernandez)

* I review articles for well-recognised conferences in the Programming Languages field
