## **June  2021**

- Our paper "Dala: A Simple Capability-Based Dynamic Language Design For Data
  Race-Freedom" has been accepted at [Onward! Papers track](https://2021.splashcon.org/track/splash-2021-Onward-papers).
  Abstract follows:

  ```
  Dynamic languages like Erlang, Clojure, JavaScript, and E adopted data-race
  freedom by design. To enforce data-race freedom, these languages either deep
  copy objects during actor (thread) communication or proxy back to their owning
  thread. We present Dala, a simple programming model that ensures data-race
  freedom while supporting efficient inter-thread communication. Dala is a
  dynamic, concurrent, capability-based language that relies on three core
  capabilities: immutable values can be shared freely; isolated mutable objects
  can be transferred between threads but not aliased; local objects can be
  aliased within their owning thread but not dereferenced by other
  threads. Objects with capabilities can co-exist with unsafe objects, that are
  unchecked and may suffer data races, without compromising the safety of safe
  objects. We present a formal model of Dala, prove data race-freedom and state
  and prove a dynamic gradual guarantee. These theorems guarantee data
  race-freedom when using safe capabilities and show that the addition of
  capabilities is semantics preserving modulo permission and cast errors.
  ```

## **May 2021**

- My submitted talk to Code BEAM V was not selected; they liked it and my talk has been scheduled as
  a backup talk, i.e.,  if a speaker cannot present, then I am next in line to present.

- We submitted a paper to Onwards!

- My talk `The Three Little Monads (And Their Friends)` has been accepted to [TheKonferenSE'21](https://thekonferen.se/). Abstract follows:

```
  Once upon a time, mother sent their three little monads to type-check an evil
  wolf program. Little MonadReader was good at remembering the surrounding
  environment but the wolf knew how to trick her; little pig MonadError knew
  when to exit and leave the current task, but the wolf knew that alone little
  MonadError could not type-check the program by herlself; little pig
  MonadWriter knew how to aggregate things but not much more. The three little
  monads learnt that together they can create a powerful yet simple static
  analysis tool to type-check evil programs. Together with their friends Monoid
  and Type State, the three little monads know how to forbid the wolf from
  knocking on their homes.

  This talk assumes knowledge of Haskell, three basic monads, and some knowledge/intuition
  for monad transformers. The goal is to build a type-checker taking inspiration
  from Purescript and the Encore type-checkers. If time allows, we can dive
  into type-level computations to type state, which statically forbids
  unannotated abstract syntax trees to be returned as annotated (type-checked)
  abstract syntax trees. This technique lends well to any other static
  analysis, e.g., checking reference uniqueness. Based on the paper
  'Developing a monadic type checker for an object-oriented language: an
  experience report' (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3357766.3359545) but
  going to the core and meat of the problem :)
```

## **March 2021**

- Our paper was rejected from ECOOP'21.

- I submitted a talk to CODE BEAM V - Europe, abstract follows:

  ```
  Documentation is key for smooth communication and synchronisation
  between teams/clients.  For some time, our team maintained the documentation by
  hand. This is an error prone task, e.g., it is easy to forget to add fields,
  examples may be broken over time when fields are deprecated, etc.

  This talks explains our approach towards taming our API documentation by using
  schema validation and the OpenAPI specification. Among the greatest benefits,
  we show how we get documentation type-checking, and how we validate
  request/responses in Erlang with Schema Validation and its integration with OpenAPI.
  ```

  (Agoric)](https://agoric.com/authors/mark-s-miller/).

* I was sub-reviewer of ESOP papers.

## **November 2020**

* I submitted my Ph.D. thesis with title "Abstractions to Control the Future".
  The abstract follows:

  ```
  Multicore and manycore computers are the norm nowadays, and users have
  expectations that their programs can do multiple things concurrently.  To
  support that, developers use concurrency abstractions such as threads,
  promises, futures, and/or channels to exchange information.  All these
  abstractions introduce trade-offs between the concurrency model and the
  language guarantees, and developers accept these trade-offs for the benefits of
  concurrent programming.

  Many concurrent languages are multi-paradigm, e.g., mix the functional and
  object-oriented paradigms. This is beneficial to developers because they can
  choose the most suitable approach when solving a problem.  From the point of
  view of concurrency, purely functional programming languages are data-race free
  since they only support immutable data. Object-oriented languages do not get a
  free lunch, and neither do multi-paradigm languages that have imperative
  features.

  The main problem is uncontrolled concurrent access to shared mutable state,
  which may inadvertently introduce data-races.  A data-race happens when two
  concurrent memory operations target the same location, at least one of them is
  a write, and there is no synchronisation operation involved.  Data-races make
  programs to exhibit (unwanted) non-deterministic behaviour.

  The contribution of this thesis is two-fold. First, this thesis introduces new
  concurrent abstractions in a purely functional, statically typed programming
  language (Paper I -- III); these abstractions allow developers
  to write concurrent control- and delegation-based patterns. Second, this thesis
  introduces a capability-based dynamic programming model, named Dala,
  that extends the applicability of the concurrent abstractions to an imperative
  setting while maintaining data-race freedom (Paper IV). Developers can also
  use the Dala model to migrate unsafe programs, i.e., programs that may
  suffer data-races, to data-race free programs.
  ```


## **September 2020**

* I will TA the course Functional Programming I at Uppsala University, where
  students will learn about functional programming using Haskell.  The course
  covers functions, recursion, inductive types, polymorphism (type variables and
  type classes), modules and IO.

## **July 2020**

* Our paper *Dalarna: A Simplistic Capability-Based Dynamic Language Design For
  Data Race Freedom* has been accepted at [22st Workshop on Formal Techniques for
  Java-like Programs (FTfJP)](https://2020.ecoop.org/details/FTfJP-2020-papers/2/Dalarna-A-Simplistic-Capability-Based-Dynamic-Language-Design-For-Data-Race-Freedom). In
  this paper, we investigate the addition of gradual capabilities to a dynamic
  language (e.g., JavaScript- or Python-like) and show how to maintain data-race freedom.
  The paper also shows how programs that may contain data-races may interact with
  data-race free programs, while maintaining data-race freedom.

* Our paper *Gradual Capabilities for Data Race Freedom* (based on
  *[Dalarna: A Simplistic Capability-Based Dynamic Language Design For
  Data Race Freedom](https://2020.ecoop.org/details/FTfJP-2020-papers/2/Dalarna-A-Simplistic-Capability-Based-Dynamic-Language-Design-For-Data-Race-Freedom)*) has been rejected from OOPSLA 2020 (but we got really good feedback
  to continue improving our work).

## **June 2020**

* I am honored to be a program commitee member of the
  [International Conference on Code Quality (ICCQ)](https://www.iccq.ru/).

## **April 2020**

* I presented the paper [Developing a Monadic Type Checker for an Object-Oriented
  Language](https://doi.org/10.1145/3357766.3359545) for which I am a co-author
  at the [Func Prog Sweden
  MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/Func-Prog-Sweden/events/269811606/), which was
  also the first time that I presented in an online event.

## **January 2020**

* I am honored to be part of the [ECOOP'20 Artifact Evaluation
  Committee](https://2020.ecoop.org/track/ecoop-2020-artifacts).

* Gave a talk about how to produce research artifacts, covering the motivation,
  and giving examples of my experience so far. I gave this talk to the CsD
  Department in IT in Uppsala University ([slide here](files/HowToCreateGreatArtifact.pdf)).

* Finished a series of articles explaining how to use Pandoc, from producing
  epubs and websites, to writing research papers and software artifacts:

  * [Convert files at the command line with Pandoc](https://opensource.com/article/18/9/intro-pandoc)
  * [Turn your book into a website and an ePub using Pandoc](https://opensource.com/article/18/10/book-to-website-epub-using-pandoc)
  * [How to use Pandoc to produce a research paper](https://opensource.com/article/18/9/pandoc-research-paper)
  * [Automating the creation of research artifacts](https://opensource.com/article/20/1/automating-documentation)

## **October 2019**


* Our paper [Developing a Monadic Type Checker for an Object-Oriented Language:
  An Experience Report](https://doi.org/10.1145/3357766.3359545) received the
  Distinguished Artifact Award at the [ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on
  Software Language Engineering
  (SLE'19)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/sle-2019).  This is a joint effort
  with [Elias Castegren](https://eliasc.github.io/). In a tutorial-like style,
  the paper explains how to design a monadic type checker in Haskell. The
  artifact contains an incremental implementation of the monadic type
  checker. This design is based on the work performed on the [Encore
  compiler](https://github.com/parapluu/encore). We are grateful to [Stephan
  Brandauer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephan-brandauer/), [Tobias
  Wrigstad](http://wrigstad.com/), [Dave
  Clarke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davegclarke/), and [Albert Mingkun
  Yang](http://albertnetymk.github.io/) who influenced the design of the Encore
  compiler.

* As part of my research visit at Victoria University of New Zealand, we have
started a collaboration with researchers from Victoria University, James Noble
and Isaac O. Gariano.  This collaboration will extend the work from our [VMIL
paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01465), where we are exploring how to add
gradual reference capabilities to an untyped language.

## **September 2019**

* Our paper "Run, Actor, Run: Towards Cross-Actor Language Benchmarking" has
been accepted at the Workshop on Programming based on Actors, Agents, and
Decentralized Control (AGERE!). In this paper, we investigate runtime
performance of the Savina benchmarks, and investigate how many programs have
similar runtime characteristics, and/or that their runtime behaviour may
drastically change nature (e.g.,go from essentially sequential to parallel) by
tweaking some parameters. This observation lead us to propose a single benchmark
program which we designed so that through tweaking of some knobs (we hope) we
can simulate most of the programs of the Savina suite.

* Our paper ["Towards Gradual Checking of Reference Capabilities"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01465)
(work-in-progress) has been accepted at the [Virtual Machines and Intermediate
Languages Workshop
(VMIL)](https://2019.splashcon.org/home/vmil-2019#event-overview). In this
paper, we propose to mix the ideas from the reference capability literature with
gradual typing, leading to gradual reference capabilities.

* Our artefact "Developing a Monadic Type Checker for an Object-Oriented
Language" has been accepted at the [International Conference on Software
Language Engineering (SLE)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/sle-2019#About). In
this artefact, you can find the multiple iterations of the monadic type checker
from the paper. All the functions are documented, and the artefact guides the
reader through the code. The type checker can be tested interactively from a
REPL, and we include examples of different programs and how to type check them
using different versions of the type checker, and their expected
result.

* Our paper "Godot: All the Benefits of
  Implicit and Explicit Futures" was accepted at ECOOP'19. The abstract of the paper reads as follows:

  > Godot: All the Benefits of Implicit and Explicit Futures
  >
  > Concurrent programs often make use of future,
  > which are handles to the results of asynchronous operations.
  >  Futures provide an instantly available means to communicate not yet
  >  computed results, and simplify the implementation of operations that
  >  must synchronise on the result of such
  >  asynchronous operations. Futures can be characterised as either
  >    implicit or explicit, depending on the typing discipline used to
  >    type them.
  >
  >  Existing approaches to implementing futures suffer from ``future proliferation'',
  >  either at the type-level or at run-time. The former
  >  manifests itself through the addition of future type wrappers
  > which expose the client to the
  > asynchronous message indirections of an implementation and hinders
  > subtype polymorphism. The latter manifests itself through increased
  > latency, by traversing
  >  nested future structures at run-time.
  >  Many languages suffer both kinds.
  >
  >  Previous work offer partial solutions to these problems of
  >    future proliferation; in this paper we show how these solutions can be
  >    integrated
  >  in an elegant and coherent way which is more expressive than either
  >  system in isolation. We describe our proposal formally, and state
  >  and prove its key properties, in two related calculi, based on the two possible families of future constructs (data-flow futures and control-flow futures). The former relies on static type information to avoid
  >  unwanted future creation and the latter uses an algebraic data type
  >  with dynamic checks. We also discuss how to implement our new system efficiently.

## **October 2018**

* I presented the paper
  "The impact of opt-in gamification on students' grades in a software design course".
  ([link to pre-print](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328115773_The_impact_of_opt-in_gamification_on_students'_grades_in_a_software_design_course))

  Abstract:

  > An achievement-driven methodology strives to give students more control of their learning with enough flexibility to engage them in deeper learning. We observed in the course Advanced Software Design, which uses the achievement-driven methodology, that students fail to get high grades, which may hamper deeper learning. To motivate students to pursue and get higher grades we added gamification elements to the course. To measure the success of our gamification implementation, students filled out a questionaire rating the enjoyment and motivation produced by the game. We built a statistical regression model where enjoyment and motivation explain 55% of the variation in grades. However, only the relationship between motivation and grade is significant, which implies that notivation drives the overall effect of the model. The results suggest that the more the students were motivated by the game, the higher their grades on the course (and vice versa). This implies that if gamification indeed motivates students, then it makes them go beyond what is expected.

* Meeting with Ludovic Henrio, Einar B. Johnsen, Dave Clarke and Tobias Wrigstad
  to discuss the difference between control-flow futures and data-flow futures,
  which was identified by Ludovic Henrio. At the end of the meeting, we are going
  to join efforts to highlight the difference between these futures and constructs
  to allow these futures to co-exist together. We will possibly produce an implementation
  in the Encore language.

  > Monads can help compiler-writers to create a clean design.
  > For example, the Encore compiler

#### **July 2018**

* My proposed presentation to LambdaWorld'18 Cadiz was rejected.

* I submitted the gamification approach that we took during the course Advanced Software Desgin
  to [EduSymp'18](http://www.edusymp.org/2018/). It was the first time that I have
  worked with [Janina Hornbach](http://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N14-1034),
  it was really fun and I am really happy with the result. Hopefully,
  we will be able to carry on the future work of the paper :)

* My proposed presentation to ClojuTRE'18 was rejected. My abstract can be found below:

> **Monoids and Monads: The secret weapon to a parallel abstraction**
>
> Why should you consider monoids when designing a parallel abstraction?
> Why monads play an important role in this setting?
> What are the benefits of using monoids and monads?
>
> In this talk, I will save you from creating a non-composable and non-parallelisable library design. To do this, I will show you why your next parallel abstraction is going to use monoids and monads, drawing examples from the (experimental) library ParT. ParT is a functional parallel abstraction that allows the developer to create and coordinate complex parallel workflows, such as asynchronous pipelines of (possibly speculative) parallel computations.
> Join me and let's ParT with monoids and monads!
