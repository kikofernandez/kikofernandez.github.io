Functional programming languages are well-suited for developing compilers, and
compilers for functional languages are often themselves written in a functional
language. Functional abstractions, such as monads, allow abstracting away some
of the repetitive structure of a compiler, removing boilerplate code and making
extensions simpler. Even so,functional languages are rarely used to implement
compilers for languages of other paradigms. This paper reports on the experience
of a four-year long project where we developed a compiler for a concurrent,
object-oriented language using the functional language Haskell.The focus of the
paper is the implementation of the typechecker, but the design works well in
static analysis tools, such as tracking uniqueness of variables to ensure
data-race freedom. The paper starts from a simple type checker to which we add
more complex features, such as type state, with minimal changes to the overall
initial design.
