Concurrent and parallel programming is difficult due to the presence of memory
side-effects, which may introduce data races. Type qualifiers, such as reference
capabilities, can remove data races by restricting sharing of mutable
data. Unfortunately, reference capability languages are an all-in or nothing
game, i.e., all the types must be annotated with reference capabilities. In this
work in progress, we propose to mix the ideas from the reference capability
literature with gradual typing, leading to gradual reference capabilities.
