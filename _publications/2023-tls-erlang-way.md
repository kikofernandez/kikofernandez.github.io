The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is one of the most used protocols to ensure data privacy, integrity and authenticity on the Internet. Erlang/OTP's TLS implementation is widely used in industry, and especially in the telecommunication sector.

This paper describes an overview of the TLS protocol in the context of Erlang. We explain Erlang/OTP's TLS protocol design and implementation, optimizations, a benchmark evaluation of the Erlang TLS protocol implementation against previous Erlang/OTP's TLS implementations, and a benchmark comparison against the Go's TLS implementation.
